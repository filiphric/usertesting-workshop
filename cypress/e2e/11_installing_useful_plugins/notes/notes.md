# Installing useful plugins
- thereâ€™s a variety of plugins available on [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins/directory), but you can also search in [npm directory](https://npmjs.com)

Most of the plugins follow a common pattern:

1. install the plugin by `npm install <plugin name>`
2. add some kind of import to `cypress/support/index.js` file
3. sometimes the plugin requires an import to `cypress/plugins/index.js` as well

Some awesome plugins out there enable you to:
- perform API testing
- add new commands to the Cypress library
- do visual testing
- test emails
- set up custom test reporters
- use cucumber bdd
- filter tests by tags
- and much more
